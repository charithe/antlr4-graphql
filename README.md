ANTLR v4 Grammar for GraphQL (October 2016 Spec)
=================================================

An ANTLR v4 grammar that can be used to generate a parser for the GraphQL October 2016 spec. Supports both
the schema definition language (entrypoint `schema`) and the query language (entrypoint `document`).

Please note that this grammar has not been extensively tested. It was part of an effort to generate a GraphQL
parser in Go. Due to the limitations of Go support in ANTLR, the project was abandoned before extensive validation
checks could be run on the generated parser.
